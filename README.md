SimpleBayes
===========

This is a Bayes-centric fork of Nick Ragaz's [fork](https://github.com/nragaz/classifier) of Lucas Carlson's [classifier](https://github.com/cardmagic/classifier) library, "... a general module to allow Bayesian and other types of classifications."

About this Fork
---------------
I needed the Bayes. I'd also like to add Redis as a persistence engine. You probably shouldn't use this yet.
